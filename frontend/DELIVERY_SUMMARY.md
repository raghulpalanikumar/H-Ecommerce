### **Immediately (Testing)**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:3001/product/1
# All features work with mock data!
```

### **For Production (Add Backend)**
Replace mock data with API calls:
```javascript
// Line 188 in ProductDetail.jsx
const productData = await apiService.getProduct(id);
setProduct(productData);
```

Then ensure your backend has:
- `GET /api/products/{id}`
- `GET /api/products/{id}/stock`
- `GET /api/products/{id}/reviews`
- `POST /api/products/{id}/reviews`

## 🔍 What's Special About This Implementation

### 1. **Separate Stock Fetching**
Stock is fetched independently from product data, allowing real-time updates without blocking the main display.

### 2. **Fallback Architecture**
Images fail gracefully - if original doesn't load, it automatically switches to a fallback placeholder.

### 3. **API-Ready Design**
Component is built to connect to your backend API, with mock data providing instant testing capability.

### 4. **Performance Optimized**
Uses React hooks (useCallback, useMemo) and lazy loading to minimize re-renders and improve speed.

### 5. **Comprehensive Documentation**
Includes 6 detailed guides covering everything from quick start to backend integration.
